### Real-time Predictive Inventory Procurement System

This project is part of the job simulation focused on AI for Cognizant’s Data Science team on Forage.


<h4> **Project Summary:** </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Conducted exploratory data analysis using Python and Google Colab for one of Cognizant’s technology-led clients, Gala Groceries. </li>
  <li> Prepared a Python module that contains code to train a model and output the performance metrics for the Machine Learning engineering team. </li>
  <li> Communicated findings and analysis in the form of a PowerPoint slide to present the results back to the business. </li>
</ul>


<h4>**Project Background:**</h4>
Gala Groceries is a technology-led grocery store chain based in the USA. They pride themselves on providing the best quality, fresh produce from locally sourced suppliers. Groceries are highly perishable items. If you overstock, you are wasting money on excessive storage and waste, but if you understock, then you risk losing customers. They use sensors to measure temperature storage facilities where products are stored in the warehouse, and they also use stock levels within the refrigerators and freezers in store. They want to know how to better stock the items that they sell.


<h4> **Project Goal:** </h4>
Accurately predict the stock levels of products based on sales data and sensor data on an hourly basis in order to more intelligently procure products from suppliers.


<h4> **Implementation:** </h4>
**Task - 1**
1. Collect a sample dataset from Data Engineering team for the given problem statement.
2. Load the data into Google Colab and start performing exploratory data analysis.
    <ul>
      <li> Understand the features of data.</li>
    </ul>
3. Conduct Statistical Analysis
    <ul>
      <li> This helps is understanding the numerical features and the distribution of values.</li>
    </ul>
3. Initial Visualization
    <ul>
      <li> Play with various visualizations to understand the correlation between different features and significance of specific features.</li>
    </ul>
4. From the initial analysis of the data:
    <ul>
      <li> Document summary of the analysis</li>
      <li> Come up with questions or further requirements needed to proceed with the project</li>
      <li> Report these to the team leader and business stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>
